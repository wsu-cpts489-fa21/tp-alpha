#### Reflection Statements
| Team Member | Communication Reflection Statement |
|-------------|-------------------|
|Hung| We were pretty successful in communicating with each other. Everyone replied in a timely manner. We decided to switch to Discord to communicate as it is a more effective system.  |
|Brian| We use Discord to message each other and have teeam meetings because all of the team members are more comfortable with this platform.  Questions through messaging were answered quickly and our meetings were effective.  We plan to have more planned out meetings during the next milestone. |
|Desmond| Communication seems to be good overall in this team. I was able to quickly get access to our database and heroku upon request. We have had a little trouble scheduling meeting times, but that is mostly due to situations out of our control thus far. |<*Required*: The posts/replies data is unlikely to tell the whole story about your communication. Write a brief statement explaining and reflecting on your communication with your team during this milestone.> |
|Josh| Post Milestone 0, I am happy with the team communication is consistant and teammates are helpful for the most part. Looking back at my own work, I could have commited my work more as well as give status updates when I have nothing to commit. Now that my version of our web app can run on my MacOS system I think most things will be smooth from here on out. |
|Turner| <*Required*: The posts/replies data is unlikely to tell the whole story about your communication. Write a brief statement explaining and reflecting on your communication with your team during this milestone.> |

### Retrospective
See RetrospectiveMeetings folder in branch "main".

#### What went well
  - Linking our work together (Heroku, MongoDB)
  - Fast responses for questions in Discord
  - Use of Kanban board to track issues
 
  
 #### What we'd like to improve
  - More frequent communication
  - Finding good times for all 5 members to meet
  - Trying to start work earlier and commit more frequently
  
#### Changes we plan to implement in next milestone period
  - Daily status updates (even if no changes)
  - Establish set meeting times that work for everybody throughout the milestone period

|Hung| For this milestone, I worked on creating the modal dialog form for adding a new course as well as a floating action button in the Courses tab so that the user can be directed to the add course form. I also worked on implementing the Google Places autocomplete API in order to speed up the process of adding a new course. |
|Brian| My contributions to this milestone mainly consisted of setting up the server routes for Courses and getting them hooked up to the frontend.  There was a lot of collaboration between teammates in order for us to complete our tasks. |
|Desmond| For this milestone, I worked with Josh on creating the table that displays user added speed golf courses. I wrote the get and post methods for getting the courses into local storage and well as adding them to the database respectively. I also designed the course filtering method.|
|Josh| For this milestone, I worked with Desmond on creating table modal that would display and list all courses in the database, in addition to being able to search for specific courses. The specific part that I worked on creating the table and populating the database. Creating table was easy for the most part, however populating it was a bit more difficult due to not quite understanding how to retrieve that data. Luckily I was able to work through it with my team members and get it working. |

|Hung| We did pretty well in terms of communication for this milestone. Everyone was able to attend our meeting times based on the schedule we agreed upon in the last TPM. When group members had questions, it was answered in a very timely manner. We all helped each other out whenever an issue would arise. |
|Brian| I thought that communication during this milestone went really smoothly.  We implemented our plan from the previous TPM0 to meet every other day (Mon, Wed, Fri) in order to provide updates and figure out tasks for teammates.  We also responded to messages quickly in our Discord server and were able to help each other with any issues that arose. |
|Desmond| Communication was generally good, however more time was needed doing concurrent programming. |
|Josh| Communication wise this milestone I think we did pretty well, while there may have been some confusion on what each of us were doing we were quick to respond to each other in discord and sort out any issues that arise. |


### Retrospective

See RetrospectiveMeetings folder in `main` branch.

#### What went well
 
- Meeting Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at set times.
- Working in pairs went well.

#### What we'd like to improve

- Better outlining / planning.
- Better source control flow / branch management.

#### Changes we plan to implement in next milestone period

- Going through story tasks and figuring out exactly what needs to be done and the dependencies between tasks.
- Meet more frequently next week due to shorter timeline for tasks.

We worked on making Google autocomplete work correctly for the courseForm, while still allowing users to manually enter / edit information.  Additionally, we added the routes for adding and getting tees, which are displayed in the courseForm itself.  Users are now able to add tees for a specific course, and are saved to the database.  Much of this work was done together and in tandem, as there was much dependency between the UI, backend, and hooking them up together.  Lastly, as time allowed, we began implementing functionality for badges earned through rounds, but didn't have time to get very far into this.</td>

|Brian| Worked in tandem with Hung to complete issue 45, which was adding /editing / deleting courses and using Google autocomplete. We got most of this issue done, but weren't exactly clear on the specific requirements of multiple holes within a tee (as neither of us are golfers).  We also really tried to get the max SGS score of users for a specific golf course, but struggled with this to the point that we weren't able to implement it.  Final attempt is commented out in the code.  Other than these two minor problems, issue 45 is complete.|
